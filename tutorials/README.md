# ByteHub Tutorials

1. [Quick-start guide](01_bytehub_quick_start.ipynb)
2. [Bitcoin price data](02_bitcoin_prices.ipynb) demonstrates feature transforms.
3. [ByteHub Cloud](03_bytehub_cloud_intro.ipynb) shows how to access [ByteHub.ai's cloud-hosted feature store](https://www.bytehub.ai/feature-store/request-access).
4. [Cloud storage](04_using_cloud_storage.ipynb) demonstrates how to store feature data using storage providers like AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.
5. [Data preparation](05_data_prep_carbon_intensity.ipynb) shows how feature transforms can be used to organise and automate data prep tasks. We use [electricity carbon intensity data](https://www.carbonintensity.org.uk/) as an example.
6. [Timeseries forecasting](06_timeseries_forecasting.ipynb) demonstrates how a feature store can be used as part of a timeseries forecasting problem. We use Tensorflow's [timeseries forecasting tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series), and implement the data-prep and feature engineering in ByteHub.
